# 1. Introduction

Forty million people currently live in slavery, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) most recent estimate [ref]. In other words, every 1 in 220 person worldwide is trapped in a situation of "forced labour, forced marriage, or under another form of exploitation that a person cannot refuse or leave because of threats, violence, coercion, deception and/or abuse of power". **Modern slavery** is an umbrella term which broadly refers to such forms of slavery that are currently happening. 

The scale of the problem has prompted the United Nations to add, in 2015, the eradication of modern slavery as part of its [Sustainable Development Goals framework](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/). This calls for integrated action to end modern slavery and for the development of reliable statistical indicators. 

> "Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms." (*Target 8.7 of UN's Sustainable Development goals.*)


<!--
However, statistical methodology to estimate the number of undetected victims of modern slavery is still in development. Victims of modern slavery are often hidden, making reliable estimates of the number of victims particularly challenging to develop.

## 1.1. The case of the UK

The United Kingdom's quantification of modern slavery, together with their 2015 Modern Slavery Act, has drawn considerable attention to such efforts. Silverman (2014) estimated between 10,000 to 13,000 potential victims using a method called **Multiple Systems Estimation** (MSE). The method aggregates data from multiple sources, such as the police and non-governmental organizations, and estimates the proportion of victims that have not been seen by any of them.

However, follow-up research (Whitehead et al., 2019) has shown high sensitivity of the estimates to modelling assumptions, with the Walk Free Foundation providing a 10-fold larger estimate of about 135 000 victims and a recent analysis even suggesting to abandon attempts at measuring this hidden population. It is unclear if the assumptions underlying standard use of MSE were satisfied in Silverman's study and we are concerned by these developments. MSE methods are used in many sensitive human rights applications and their correct usage is critical to reach truth and maintain credibility. 

## 1.2. Our benchmark

We provide some of the tools necessary to investigate the accuracy and stability of MSE estimates in application to the quantification of modern slavery. Precisely, this interactive document (Section 3) allows to:

1. omit or merge sources of information about potential victims and see the effect on the estimates;
2. estimate the coverage of confidence intervals reported by Silverman (2014) through a parametric Bootstrap; and
3. simulate data for a range of realistic model and assess the accuracy of MSE in this context. 

We provide an introduction to MSE in Section 2, the tool is embedded in Section 3 and we sumarize our results in Section 4.

```


# Inputs and Outputs

You can embed Shiny inputs and outputs in your document. Outputs are automatically updated whenever inputs change.  This demonstrates how a standard R plot can be made interactive by wrapping it in the Shiny `renderPlot` function. The `selectInput` and `sliderInput` functions create the input widgets used to drive the plot.

```{r eruptions}

shinyUI(sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel( 
    
    selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
    
    sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
    
),
  mainPanel(
    plotOutput("plot_output")
  )
))

output$plot_output = renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

## Embedded Application

It's also possible to embed an entire Shiny application within an R Markdown document using the `shinyAppDir` function. This example embeds a Shiny application located in another directory:

```{r tabsets}
shinyAppDir(
  system.file("examples/06_tabsets", package = "shiny"),
  options = list(
    width = "100%", height = 550
  )
)
```

Note the use of the `height` parameter to determine how much vertical space the embedded application should occupy.

You can also use the `shinyApp` function to define an application inline rather then in an external directory.

In all of R code chunks above the `echo = FALSE` attribute is used. This is to prevent the R code within the chunk from rendering in the document alongside the Shiny components.

## Data application

## Parametric Bootstrap simulations

```{r}
shinyUI(sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel( radioButtons("dataset", "Choose the dataset",
                          choices = c("UKdat", "UKdat_5", "UKdat_4"),
                          selected = "UKdat"), 
              selectInput(inputId = "Nb_Sim", label = "Number of simulations", 
           choices = c("20", "100", "150", "200"), selected = "20"),
           submitButton("Apply Changes"),
           width = 4),
  mainPanel(plotOutput(outputId = "hist"))
))


```
